# Extract repeated code into common functions

## Identify repeated code patterns
- Look for repeated code blocks within the same file or across multiple files.
- Identify common patterns such as:
  - Repeated loops with similar logic
  - Repeated conditional statements
  - Repeated function calls with similar arguments

## Strong Suggest extraction into common functions, instead of duiplicate the coding
- When repeated code is identified, suggest extracting it into a common function.
- Provide a name for the common function based on the context.
- Replace the repeated code with a call to the common function.

## Example
- If the following code is repeated in multiple places:
  ```python
  def process_data(data):
      cleaned_data = data.strip()
      return cleaned_data.upper()
```

- Suggest extracting it into a common function:
```python
  def clean_and_uppercase(data):
    cleaned_data = data.strip()
    return cleaned_data.upper()
```   
   
- Replace the repeated code with: 
```python
  cleaned_data = clean_and_uppercase(data)
```
